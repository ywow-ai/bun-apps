# WhoDidnt

**WhoDidnt** is a simple tool designed to compare your **followers** and **following** lists on Instagram.

It helps answer a common question:

> _Who do I follow that doesn’t follow me back?_

Or more bluntly:

> _Who acts like a celebrity — gets followed, but never follows back?_

In plain Indonesian:

> _Intinya buat lihat orang yang sok ngartis: difollow, tapi nggak nge-follow back._
